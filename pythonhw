1. Write a list comprehension to return union of 2 list
2. Implement set function on list. For example, take 2 list as input & return union,intersection,symmetric_difference,difference,ISdisjoint of them.
3. Use fromkeys in dictionary, and provide values from the list to individual keys. For example
y = dict.fromkeys(x,[7,8,9]), here 7, 8 ,9 etc should be assigned to keys in y respectively.
